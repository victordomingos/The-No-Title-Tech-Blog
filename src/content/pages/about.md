The No Title<sup>Â®</sup> Tech Blog is a place for experimentation. I started it as a small personal challenge, just to see if I could implement a Python-based workflow for easy web publishing, without the need for any special local or remote hardware requirements.

By that time, I had just heard about [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/){target=:_blank}, a static site generator, so why not start experimenting with it? Then I tried to `pip install` it into [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/){target=:_blank} and I decided that my workflow should be compatible with both desktop Python (for me that means Python 3.6+ on macOS) and mobile Python (for me, at this time, that specifically means Pythonista).

Of course, a project like this is a fun opportunity to mess around with lots of interesting stuff, like [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown){target=:_blank}, [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org){target=:_blank}, [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets){target=:_blank} and [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org){target=:_blank} templates customization, [image optimization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization){target=:_blank}, [page speed optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_performance){target=:_blank}, [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization){target=:_blank}, iOS productivity apps, [Git versioning](https://git-scm.com){target=:_blank} and a little bit of [Python](https://www.python.org){target=:_blank}. As so, you definitely should expect it to change every once in a while, or even find out that something is broken. I may be or may not be working in a fix for those issues, so please feel free to drop me a message anywhere or even to file a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/victordomingos){target=:_blank}. I will try to respond as soon as possible.
