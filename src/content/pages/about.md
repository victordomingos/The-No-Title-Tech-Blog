The No Title\<sup\>Â®\</sup\> Tech Blog is a virtual place for real experimentation. I started it as a small personal challenge, just to see if I could implement a Python-based workflow for easy web publishing, without the need for any special local or remote hardware requirements.

By that time, I had just heard about Pelican, a static site generator, so why not start experimenting with it? Then I tried to `pip install` it into Pythonista and I decided that my workflow should be compatible with both desktop Python (for me that means Python 3.6+ on macOS) and mobile Python (for me, at this time, that specifically means Pythonista).

Of course, a project like this is a fun opportunity to mess around with lots of interesting stuff, like Markdown, HTML, CSS and Jinja2 templates customization, image optimization, iOS productivity apps, Git versioning and a little bit of Python.
