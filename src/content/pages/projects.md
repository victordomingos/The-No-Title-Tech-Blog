Title: Projects
Slug: projects

Here you can find a few of my programming projects. Most of them started as a learning experience and then evolved into a daily use tool. I like to learn through real world examples, so I always try to solve some kind of problem while learning how to use a new Python feature or some API. So, I would probably write each of these applications in a very different way if I was starting it as a new project.

These are all open source projects, that are available on GitHub. Please feel free to check the license, clone them, use them, or even contribute back.
