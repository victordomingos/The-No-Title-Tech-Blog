Title: Count Files
Slug: count-files
Lang: en
Status: hidden
Cover: images/projects/count-files.png

A little command-line interface (CLI) utility written in Python to help you count files, grouped by extension, in a directory. By default, it will count files recursively in current working directory and all of its subdirectories, and will display a table showing the frequency for each file extension (e.g.: .txt, .py, .html, .css) and the total number of files found.

Optionally, you can pass it a path to the directory to scan. If you prefer, you can leave that argument empty, and it will scan the current working directory.
