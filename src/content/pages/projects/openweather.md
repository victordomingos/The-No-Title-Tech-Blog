![OpenWeather - Check the weather in your iPhone using a Python app]({filename}/images/projects/openweather.png)
A little fun project made in an iPhone using Pythonista. It's a nicely formatted console app that checks the weather forecast for the next few days. This version is custom made for iPhone, so it uses Pythonista 3. It makes use of the web API provided by openweathermap.org. It shows the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. It can use the device's barometer and location services, if available. If they are not available, the app falls back, respectively, to the data provided by the web API and a default location.
