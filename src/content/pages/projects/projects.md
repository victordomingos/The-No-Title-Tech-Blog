<article>
<p>Here you can find a few of my programming projects. Most of them started as a learning experience and then evolved into a daily basis tool. I like to learn through real world examples, so I always try to solve some kind of problem while learning how to use a new Python feature or some API. So, I would probably write each of these applications in a very different way if I was starting it as a new project.</p>

<p>These are all open source projects, that are available on <a href="https://github.com/victordomingos" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. Please feel free to check the license, clone them, use them, or even contribute back.</p>

A cross-platform desktop utility for amateur astronomy hobbyists, written in Java. The aim is to provide an easy to use tool to help planning sky observation sessions, suggesting some of the interesting objects you may be able to watch at naked eye, or using amateur equipment (binoculars or small to medium size telescopes) in a given date/time and place.

  <div class="content">
A command-line interface (CLI) utility written in (almost) pure Python to help you reduce the file size of images. It can process a single file, a folder's root or all images in a folder, recursively. Multiple image processing tasks are automatically distributed to all available cores, getting the most of the specific device being used.

A command-line interface (CLI) utility written in Python to help you count files, grouped by extension, in a directory. By default, it will count files recursively in current working directory and all of its subdirectories, and will display a table showing the frequency for each file extension (e.g.: .txt, .py, .html, .css) and the total number of files found.

  <div class="content">
A set of two Python scripts made to automate a simple off-site backup operation in a headless
Mac mini server using Dropbox. One script zips any new files/folders in a specified folder and
then uploads the archive to Dropbox. The other (running in another machine with Dropbox
sync enabled) removes the older archives, after a specified number of days. Why all tis work?
Well, the regular Dropbox app didn't run anymore on such an old operating system (Snow
Leopard), but Python and the Dropbox API did. Just added the main script to <b>launchd</b> and it worked like a charm!
