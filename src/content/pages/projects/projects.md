Title: Projects
Slug: projects

<article>
Here you can find a few of my programming projects. Most of them started as a learning experience and then evolved into a daily use tool. I like to learn through real world examples, so I always try to solve some kind of problem while learning how to use a new Python feature or some API. So, I would probably write each of these applications in a very different way if I was starting it as a new project.

These are all open source projects, that are available on GitHub. Please feel free to check the license, clone them, use them, or even contribute back.

  <div class="content">
A set of two Python scripts made to automate a simple off-site backup operation in a headless Mac mini server using Dropbox. One script zips any new files/folders in a specified folder and then uploads the archive to Dropbox. The other (running in another machine with Dropbox sync enabled) removes the older archives, after a specified number of days. Why all tis work? Well, the regular Dropbox app didn't run anymore on such an old operating system (Snow Leopard), but Python and the Dropbox API did. Just added the main script to *launchd* and it worked like a charm!

A little fun project made in an iPhone using Pythonista. It's a nicely formatted console app that checks the weather forecast for the next few days. This version is custom made for iPhone, so it uses Pythonista 3. It makes use of the web API provided by openweathermap.org. It shows the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days.
