Summary: This is a book written for those who already have some object-oriented programming background but are willing to get into Python and (especially) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

In the first half, it provides a quick introduction to the Python language that will be easy to follow by experienced programmers, while also introducing some basic data science topics. In chapters 1 to 10, each chapter presents a selection of Python features, like data types, control statements, and exception handling. At the same time, each of those chapters includes a brief mention on data science. For instance, in chapter 2 the authors invite you to learn or recall some basic descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, range), showing how easy it is to calculate them in Python. Then, in chapter 3, they take you a little further and let you add mean, median, and mode to your toolset.

It’s worth mentioning that, while this approach of mixing the teaching of a programming language with Data Science concepts may seem a bit confusing at first, it rapidly starts to make sense, as the internal chapter structure becomes apparent: an introduction, then some Python that coherently builds on the topics from the previous chapters, then something on data wrangling or statistics, then a wrap-up section that helps you recap what you have just read. Once you grasp that structure, it becomes much easier to navigate through this part of the book.

Chapter 10 follows the same structure but is kind of a turning point. It finally presents Python’s object-orientedness and a slightly more advanced data science concept, simple linear regression. Up to this point, the reader (assuming he/she has been reading every chapter in a sequential way) has been exposed to the basics of Python syntax and data structures, some useful third-party modules and tools like IPython, Jupyter Notebooks, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas, as well as CSV and JSON manipulation.

In chapter 11, you’ll find out that the authors are focusing more on data science and less on Python concepts. The reader is expected now to be familiar with the language syntax and the commonly used data structures, so the last half of the book serves to present some more specialized topics related to A.I. and Big Data. Chapter 11 presents Natural language Processing (NLP) and includes exercises on web scraping. Then you have a chapter on data mining.
On chapter 13, you will get a first experience with IBM Watson and cognitive computing.

--- some interesting trivia on IBM Watson---

Sounds hard, but in fact it is al presented in a gradual progression, leaving much of the inherent complexity to a later (and deeper) dive into IBM’s documentation. IBM offers many different cloud computing services, that could never fit in a single chapter, or even a single book, so the authors have decided to show a few examples

---- exampes? ----
and to recommend the reader to create a user account on IBM’s Bluemix and to explore their API documentation and tutorials.
On chapter 14, we get introduced to the basics of machine learning, including the concepts of classification, regression and clustering.

Chapter 15 goes even deeper, focusing on Deep Learning, convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
