Summary: Do you know that nice feeling that comes from getting a mission accomplished? There is nothing like watching some of our work come to life.

Well, some time ago, I have [started collaborating as a volunteer translator in open source software projects]({filename}/articles/2018/2018-10-31_translating_haiku_operating_system_to_portuguese.md), including [Haiku](https://haiku-os.org){:target=_blank} and some of its applications. And to celebrate the fact that a few of those translations are finally being released in the most recent updates, I am right now writing this article in [Koder](https://github.com/KapiX/Koder){:target=_blank}, one of the Haiku apps I have recently translated to Portuguese.

Besides Koder (which, as the name implies, is a text editor for code), [QuickLaunch](https://github.com/humdingerb/quicklaunch){:target=_blank} (an application launcher for Haiku that is very similar to Spotlight on macOS) was also recently updated with my Portuguese translation. These are the first of a few more that are complete and should also be released soon, including, for instance, [Paladin](https://github.com/adamfowleruk/Paladin){:target=_blank} (an IDE for Haiku), [BePDF](https://github.com/HaikuArchives/BePDF){:target=_blank} (a PDF viewer and annotation tool), [BePodder](https://github.com/HaikuArchives/BePodder){:target=_blank} (podcasts and RSS subscriptions manager), Clipdinger (a clipboard manager) and the HaikuDepot Server.

But I can't deny I am particularly interested in another big translation project I have collaborated a lot, but that still has its release pending: the Haiku operating system itself. I did in fact a big effort over some months, in collaboration with some other volunteers, to grow the Portuguese translation from around 20% to over 70%. It will certainly make a difference for Portuguese Haiku users, but probably the new translations will not be merged much before the release of Haiku R1/Beta 2.

Meanwhile, I am looking forward to getting into some cool stuff. But that's for another day. ;-)
