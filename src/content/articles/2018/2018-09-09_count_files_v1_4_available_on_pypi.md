Summary: The latest release of this file counting command-line utility has just been released. It is a platform independent (pure Python) package that makes it easy to count files by extension. This version has some useful new features. It was tested in a wide range on environments and, for the first time, it is now available on PyPI, which means you can just `pip install` it as any other Python package.


Our team member [Nataliia Bondarenko](https://github.com/NataliaBondarenko){target=:_blank} has done an amazing work in several areas of the project, especially the implementation of the unit test system, as well as adding new features and improving documentation. Thank you very much, Nataliia!

Here are some highlights:

 * Reworked some of the internals so that the application is a lot faster and more responsive.

 * Updated preview for text files and added list of supported types.
 * Added support for (optional) case sensitiveness.
 * Added support for search/count files without extension (.) or all files(..).
 * Optional display of file sizes.
 * More detailed help system.
 * Tests for different operating systems.
 * Added extensive documentation in English, Portuguese, Russian and Ukrainian.
