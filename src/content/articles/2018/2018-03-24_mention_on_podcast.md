Summary: In a recent episode of the [Python Bytes podcast](http://bit.ly/PyBytes63){:target=_blank}, some of my programming projects are briefly mentioned, as a concrete example of how complex Python and tkinter may be used to create complex and good looking desktop graphical user interfaces.

One of the applications mentioned in that podcast is [PT Tracking](http://bit.ly/PTTracking), a little utility that allows to keep a register and track shipments and registered mail send through the portuguese mail companies CTT and CTT Expresso. It also helps in making sure that all checks for orders with payment on delivery are correctly received and deposited on the bank on the correct date.

By the way, [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm){:target=_blank} is a really nice podcast, with relatively brief and very well paced episodes focusing mainly on Python news and tips. So, if you're interested in Python, I really think you should subscribe it and listen to each episode.
