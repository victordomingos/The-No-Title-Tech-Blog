Summary: Since I started discovering Python about two years ago, my learning path has been made of a lot of small steps. And today was no exception (no Python pun intended).

That's right. I have been fighting with `setup.py` files in a very awkward way all this time â€“ simply ignoring them. I knew of their existance, I knew they were important for package management and that they were probably a very important tool to enable a simple instalation process using `pip`. Though I kept running my applications directly from their main `.py` file, and it cartainly was one of the reasons that kept my projects away from PyPI. 

So, today I did two small actions that I am sure will be important for my current and future programming projects. I wrote my first `setup.py` file (nothing very fancy, but still very handy) and I registered my accounts on both TestPyPI and PyPI. If all goes as expected, sometime soon there should be some of my projects available for `pip install`.

The last few days brought a nice surprise to me, which was the first active code contributor on a GitHub project, discussing issues and submiting pull requests. [Natalia Bondarenko](https://github.com/NataliaBondarenko), from Ukraine, has cebome  very helpful team member, who has been contributing with new features, code improvement and test automation for [Count Files](). Thank you very much and welcome aboard, Natalia!
