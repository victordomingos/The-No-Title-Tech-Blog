Summary: This is the first blog post here, and it will serve just to test [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com){target=":_blank"}, a Python-based static website generation system. Hopefully, it will work without any explosion or traceback.

Meanwhile, if you are reading this post, I strongly encourage you to open the Python REPL and run the `import antigravity` statement. It really help us in setting the mood for the nexts posts.
