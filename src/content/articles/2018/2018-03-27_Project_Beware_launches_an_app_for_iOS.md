While there are other Python GUI toolkits aiming to enable Python developers to build and deploy iOS apps, like for instance the very nice [Pythonista app](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/){target=:_blank}, the [BeeWare](https://pybee.org){target=:_blank} project is a bit different because it aims at cross-platform compatibility and native widgets with a set of different tools, like Briefcase and Toga.
