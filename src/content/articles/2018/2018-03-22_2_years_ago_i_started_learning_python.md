Status: draft

Two years ago, in february 2016, I decided to start learning Python. I had very little programming experience, so almost everything was new to me.

My previous experiences with programming, back in my school years, included some lines of Basic just printing some text to the screen and playing some notes in the builtin speaker of an old Amstrad diskless computer, with a few `goto` statements in the middle. I had no computer at home, so I didn't explore it any further at that time. Then, a few years later, when we were asked to use graphical calculators in the Maths class, I got a new oportunity to actually do something. I did a fake operating system in Casio Basic that acted as a launcher for the apps or scripts I had in my calculator. It was a very limited programming environment, but it was very fun.

Meanwhile, I learned a bit of HTML
