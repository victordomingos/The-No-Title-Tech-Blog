Summary: The Python development team has just released the final versions of both Python 3.7.0 and 3.6.6.

While Python 3.6.6 is a mainly a maintenance release, Python 3.7 brings some new features that you may be interested on.

Here are some highlights:

 * Python 3.7 is faster! As always it depends of your code, but for me, I am getting about  **50% faster times** in my [Optimize Images]({filename}/pages/projects/optimize-images.md) application, just by switching from Python 3.6  to Python 3.7, which is an insanely cool improvement. In other applications, though, the performance improvements are not so drastic. For instance, I got a [virtually null] improvement of 1 to 2 % in [Count Files]({filename}/pages/projects/count-files.md), in case you were curious about it).
 
 * Data classes - a simpler way to define classes to store data, requiring less boilerplate code.
 
 * Dictionaries are now ordered. It used to be a CPython implementation detail in 3.6, but in Python 3.7 it's now considered an official part of the Python language specification.

 * Built-in `breakpoint()` function, to make debugging easier.
 
 * `async` and `await` are now reserved keywords, and the `asyncio` module has some usability and performance improvements.
 
 * Nanosecond precision timers in the `time` module.

 * On its versions for macOS (both 3.7 and 3.6.5+), in case you haven't noticed, Python is now being bundled with Tcl/Tk interpreter for `tkinter`. So, not only you don't need to install it manually from a third-party, but you also get access to a newer version that may have some new improvements. It includes a new themed `ttk.Spinbox` widget) and it should now finally support PNG images.
